Toy Chica (Five Nights at Freddy's 2)\n2. Balloon Boy (Five Nights at Freddy's 2)\n3. Mangle (Five Nights at Freddy's 2)\n4. Freddy Fazbear (Five Nights at Freddy's)\n5. Golden Freddy (Five Nights at Freddy's)\n6. Nightmare Foxy (Five Nights at Freddy's 4)\n7. Baby (Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location)\n8. Ennard (Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location)\n9. Springtrap (Five Nights at Freddy's 3)\n10. Nightmare Fredbear (Five Nights at Freddy's 4)\n\nHypothetically, a new jumpscare could involve a new animatronic character that suddenly appears behind the player and lets out a bone-chilling scream, accompanied by a sudden, violent jolt to the player's VR headset, resulting in a total sensory overload. In terms of intensity, this jumpscare would likely rank near the top of any list."},{"role":"user","content":"Astro write a poem about wanted to play Valorant with your friends, but only on the condition that a full team of five is playing"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Yearning to Play Valorant\n\nI sit at my desk and stare at the screen,\nAs the hours tick by, it's clear what I mean,\nI want to play Valorant, with all of my might,\nBut only with five, it just feels right.\n\nI long for the rush of a match well-played,\nWith a team of friends, our skills all arrayed,\nCommunicating and strategizing in sync,\nTaking down enemies in a seamless link.\n\nBut the wait can be long, the team hard to find,\nAs I sit and ponder, the thought creeps to mind,\nShould I play solo or wait for my crew?\nMy heart says the latter, the former won't do.\n\nSo I bide my time, and I keep my aim true,\nKnowing the squad will regroup, to see the battle through,\nFor there's nothing quite like the rush I get,\nFrom tactical play with my teammates set.\n\nSo I wait and I hope with patience and grace,\nFor the moment to come when we'll start the chase,\nA team of five, all ready to show,\nThat Valorant is our game, and we're ready to go."},{"role":"user","content":"thanks babe"},{"role":"assistant","content":"You're welcome!
